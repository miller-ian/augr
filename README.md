SDC Project: Droid Vision

Current Capabilities:

To run generic object detector through webcam, see detector.py in "detections" and download the RetinaNet file (resnet50_coco...) at https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/tag/1.0/

To run the SSD Mobilenet model that will be part of the presented prototype, see ncsDETECT.py, also under "detections". This file runs on the Intel NCS.

To run distance approximation script, see distanceFromCamera.py under "localization". This script currently requires parameter tuning.
